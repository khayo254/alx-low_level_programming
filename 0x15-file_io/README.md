# 0x15. C - File I/O

This repository contains programs written in C language for the purpose of learning about file handling and input/output operations.

## Requirements
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`.
* Programs should be compiled using the command `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <outputfile>`.
* This project requires the use of the standard library. Commands using functions contained therein should be preceded by the directive `#include <stdlib.h>`.

## Projects
Each of the directories in this repository represent a single project, which are as follows:

### [0-read_textfile/](./0-read_textfile/)
A C program that reads a text file and prints its contents to the standard output.

### [1-create_file/](./1-create_file/)
A C program that creates a file and writes a given text to it.

### [2-append_text_to_file/](./2-append_text_to_file/)
A C program that appends text to the end of a file.

### [3-cp/](./3-cp/)
A C program that copies the contents of one file to another.

### [100-elf_header/](./100-elf_header/)
A C program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.

## Author
* These projects were completed by me, a student at ALX.
