# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This project introduces the concept of bit manipulation in C programming language. Bit manipulation is the act of manipulating individual bits of binary data, often used in low-level programming, device drivers, and cryptography.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand how to use bitwise operators to manipulate individual bits of data.
- Understand how to set, clear, toggle, and check bits within a byte or word of data.
- Understand how to perform logical and arithmetic shifts on binary data.
- Understand how to use bit fields to pack and unpack data structures.

## Requirements

To complete the tasks in this project, you should have a basic understanding of C programming language, including data types, variables, functions, and control flow. You should also have a basic understanding of binary and hexadecimal number systems.

## Project Tasks

The project tasks are organized into several files, each containing a set of functions to complete a specific task. The following is a list of the files and their corresponding tasks:

### 0-binary_to_uint.c

- Convert a binary number to an unsigned int.

### 1-print_binary.c

- Print the binary representation of an unsigned int.

### 2-get_bit.c

- Get the value of a bit at a given index.

### 3-set_bit.c

- Set the value of a bit at a given index to 1.

### 4-clear_bit.c

- Set the value of a bit at a given index to 0.

### 5-flip_bits.c

- Determine the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.

### 100-get_endianness.c

- Determine the endianness of the machine.

### 101-password

- A program that generates random passwords for the user.
