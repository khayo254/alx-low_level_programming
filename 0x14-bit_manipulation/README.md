# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This project explores the concepts of bit manipulation in C programming. It contains some commonly used functions used to manipulate a single bit or a group of bits in a memory address. 

## Files

| File                  | Description                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0-binary_to_uint.c    | Converts a binary string to an unsigned int  |
| 1-print_binary.c      | Prints the binary of a number                |
| 2-get_bit.c           | Gets a single bit from an unsigned int       |
| 3-set_bit.c           | Sets a single bit of an unsigned int         |
| 4-clear_bit.c         | Clears a single bit of an unsigned int       |
| 5-flip_bits.c         | Flips the bits of an unsigned int           |

## Requirements

The project is written and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS.

## Compilation

All of the C files are compiled using the gcc 4.8.4 compiler, with the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o [name of executable]


## Usage

Once the program is compiled, it can be executed with the following command:

$ ./[name of executable]
