# C - Doubly Linked Lists

This repository contains assignments and exercises for the **C - Doubly Linked Lists** project of the Holberton School's Low-Level Programming curriculum.

The project focuses on the implementation and manipulation of doubly linked lists in C, including creating, traversing, inserting, deleting, and printing elements of a doubly linked list.

## Learning Objectives

- What is a doubly linked list and how to use it
- When and why to use doubly linked lists over singly linked lists
- How to build and manipulate a doubly linked list
- How to use doubly linked lists for practical applications

## Files

The following files are present in the repository:

| [0-print_dlistint.c](./0-print_dlistint.c)     | C function that prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.                     |
| [1-dlistint_len.c](./1-dlistint_len.c)         | C function that returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.              |

| [3-add_dnodeint_end.c](./3-add_dnodeint_end.c) | C function that adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.                  |
| [4-free_dlistint.c](./4-free_dlistint.c)       | C function that frees a doubly linked list.                                          |
| [5-get_dnodeint.c](./5-get_dnodeint.c)         | C function that returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.                        |
| [6-sum_dlistint.c](./6-sum_dlistint.c)         | C function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a doubly linked list.         |
| [7-insert_dnodeint.c](./7-insert_dnodeint.c)   | C function that inserts a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.      |
| [8-delete_dnodeint.c](./8-delete_dnodeint.c)   | C function that deletes a node at a given position in a doubly linked list.          |
| [100-password](./100-password)                 | File containing the password for the crackme2 executable.                            |
| [102-result](./102-result)                     | File containing the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers. |

## Usage

To use any of the C programs, you can compile them using a C compiler and run the resulting executable. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-print_dlistint.c -o print_dlistint
./print_dlistint
```
